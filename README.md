# My Reads Project

Is a required assessment for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree certification. It assesses abilities to develop using React.

## About

This application is to display a 'bookshelf' with three 'shelves' of books - currently reading, want to read, and read. The user searches for books from the [API] library (https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/) on the search page and then adds them to the desired shelf. The user can also move them to and from the desired shelves on the bookshelf page.

Please note that only certain search terms work with this API. Please see those in the file SearchTerms.md.

Created with Create React App - (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)

## To Run
1. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser
